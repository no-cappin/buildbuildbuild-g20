						<h2 style="color:#002034">Here's an overview of our research project.</h2>
						<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
						The Cebu-Cordova Link Expressway (CCLEX) is currently one of the longest bridges in the Philippines, 
						which was a project under the private company Metro Pacific Tollways Corporation; the same enterprise 
						behind other national roadways, such as the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway 
						(SCTEX). This started development during the leadership of former president Benigno Aquino III. However, it
						completed construction, and was inaugurated by former president Rodrigo Duterte. This made it a common 
						misconception to attribute this project to his administration, as well as his Build, Build, Build program, 
						which was Duterte's initiative of different flagship infrastructure projects all over the Philippines. The 
						inauguration date of CCLEX, April 27, 2022, coincided with the onset of the campaign season for the 2022 Philippine 
						general elections; thus, it has been a point of interest to analyze the association of misattributing tweets about this 
						project during this time period. This research project aims to discover patterns on tweets that incorrectly credit this 
						infrastructure to the Build, Build, Build campaign, with a greater objective of combating the rampant mis/disinformation 
						plague in social media today.<br>

					<div class="row">

								<span class="fa fa-search" style="font-size:120px; color:#731a1f; margin-bottom:30px"></span><br>
								<h3 style="color:#002034">Data Collection</h3>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; size:120%; color:#002034"><br>TOOLS</span><br>
								The group collected tweets primarily through two ways: the <b>Advanced Search feature</b> in the 
								Twitter website, and the automated <b>Apify Twitter Scraper</b>.<br>
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; size:120%; color:#002034">COLLECTION PERIOD</span><br>
								Data collection spanned from March 6, 2023 to April 13, 2023, while additional tweets were 
								gathered on June 16, 2023. <br>
								Overall, a total of <strong>165 tweets</strong> were gathered.
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; size:120%; color:#002034">KEYWORDS</span><br>
								Using the aforementioned tools, misattributing tweets were gathered with the following keywords: <br>
								<b>Terms related to CCLEX</b> - cclex, #cclex, cebu cordova <br>
								<b>Terms related to Build, Build, Build</b> - #buildbuildbuild, buildbuildbuild, bbb <br>
								<b>Terms related to Rodrigo Duterte</b> - #dutertelegacy #tatakduterte, tatak duterte, prrd, duterte, digong <br>
								<b>Terms related to giving credit</b> - salamat, #salamatprrd, #salamatduterte, salamat duterte, salamat prrd, thanks, project<br></p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">Any tweet that included any reference to Build, Build, Build were included, as CCLEX was not included as a flagship project in this campaign, thus crediting this project to BBB would have been misinformation.</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">Furthermore, the group only gathered misattributing tweets that were made from 2020 onwards. Only a small portion of the tweets were authored from 2016 to 2020. Thus, the inclusion of this 4-year span may skew the results, especially when performing linear regression on the frequency of tweets pre-campaign period.

								<h3 style="color:#002034">Data Features</h3>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black"><br>The following data features were recorded:<br><br>
								The credentials of the account were gathered: <b>Account Handle</b>, <b>Display Name</b>, and <b>Account Bio</b>.<br><br>
								Another data feature would be <b>Account Type</b>, wherein the accounts were classified into three categories:<br>
								- <span style="font-style:italic">Anonymous</span>, if there was no way of verifying the identities behind these accounts.<br>
								- <span style="font-style:italic">Identified</span>, if the account name or handle has verifiable credentials.<br>
								- <span style="font-style:italic">Media</span>, if the account’s primary purpose was to publish news or information in the platform.<br><br>
								Furthermore, other account information was obtained: <b>Joined Date</b>, <b>Follower Count</b> (the number of Twitter accounts that follow the author), <b>Following Count</b> (the number of Twitter accounts that the author follows), and <b>Account Location</b>.<br><br>
								Moreover, several features of the tweet were collected, such as the <b>Tweet Content</b> itself, the <b>Tweet URL</b>, and the <b>Publication Date</b> of the tweet.<br><br>
								Another feature, <b>Tweet Type</b>, was also recorded, if the tweet contains a text, image, video, URL. It also notes if the tweet was a reply or a quote tweet.<br><br>
								<b>Content Type</b> classifies the tweets into two categories:<br>
								- <span style="font-style:italic">Rational</span>, if the tweet has a purpose of being informational.<br>
								- <span style="font-style:italic">Emotional</span>, if the tweet states an opinion, emotion, or experience.<br>
								However, some tweets were classified as <i>both rational and emotional</i>, in which there were a combination of both contents in the tweet.<br><br>
								Lastly, the number of engagements with the tweet were also garnered: <b>Likes</b>, <b>Replies</b>, <b>Retweets</b>, and <b>Quote Tweets</b>.

						<h2 style="color:#002034">Let's talk about our data science methodology.</h2>
						<p></p>
					</header>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-6 col-6-medium col-12-small">
							<article class="box style2" style="align:center; width:1000px">
								<span class="fa fa-gear" style="font-size:120px; color:#731a1f; margin-bottom:30px"></span><br>
								<h3 style="color:#002034">Data Preprocessing</h3>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; size:120%; color:#002034"><br>ENSURING FORMATTING CONSISTENCY</span><br>
								For this step, the content type of the tweets were verified. Particularly, tweets that were both rational 
								and emotional were altered to have the same format of “Rational, Emotional” to ensure that the code will 
								classify the tweets into one category. Additionally, the date formats of the tweets were also rechecked, 
								and modified to have the format YY/MM/DD. This is to make it easier to sort the data upon performing linear regression.<br>
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; size:120%; color:#002034">STANDARDIZATION</span><br>
								Standardization was done with the tweets’ likes, retweets, replies, and quote tweets, by getting the z-score 
								of the tweets in terms of these four features. This was done to identify possible outliers in the dataset.
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; size:120%; color:#002034">HANDLING OUTLIERS</span><br>
								For this study, outliers were considered as tweets that attained a z-score of 3.00 and above, in terms of likes, 
								replies, retweets, and quote tweets. Upon standardization, 3 outliers were discovered. Since this is merely a 
								minimal percentage of the tweets gathered, the researchers decided to omit these tweets, bringing the total number 
								of tweets in the dataset to 162.
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; size:120%; color:#002034">CATEGORICAL DATA ENCODING</span><br>
								Additionally, certain categorical features in the dataset were converted to a quantifiable value. This is 
								particularly seen with the tweet types feature. A value of 1 was set for tweets who included a certain media type 
								(e.g. photo/video, URL), while a value of 0 indicates the absence of such.
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; size:120%; color:#002034">HANDLING MISSING VALUES</span><br>
								Upon reviewing the data collected, three features were found to be inconsistent.<br>
								<b>Views.</b> The view count of most tweets were unavailable during data collection; thus, the researchers decided 
								to disregard this tweet feature for the subsequent parts of the study. <br>
								<b>Location</b> The account locations of the tweet authors were inconsistent. Some accounts had dubious locations, 
								while others did not provide a location in their account. Meanwhile, most accounts had the location “Philippines” or 
								“Republic of the Philippines,” which are broad, and thus, will not provide much insight with the dataset. Thus, the 
								researchers have also decided to dismiss this tweet feature. <br>
								<b>Account Bio.</b> The account bios of tweet authors were also inconsistent. Similar to account location, some <br>
								accounts did not have a bio. Meanwhile, other account bios do not provide significant insight into the study, as <br>
								they were unrelated to the topic. Thus, the researchers have decided to omit this tweet feature.
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; size:120%; color:#002034">TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS PREPARATION</span><br>
								Data were binned to yearly, monthly, and weekly intervals using pivot tables in MS Excel. This is due to the difficulties
								of binning weekly intervals in Python.
