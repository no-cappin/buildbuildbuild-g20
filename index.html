						<h2 style="color:#002034">Here's an overview of our research project.</h2>
						<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
						The Cebu-Cordova Link Expressway (CCLEX) is currently one of the longest bridges in the Philippines, 
						which was a project under the private company Metro Pacific Tollways Corporation; the same enterprise 
						behind other national roadways, such as the North Luzon Expressway (NLEX) and Subic-Clark-Tarlac Expressway 
						(SCTEX). This started development during the leadership of former president Benigno Aquino III. However, it
						completed construction, and was inaugurated by former president Rodrigo Duterte. This made it a common 
						misconception to attribute this project to his administration, as well as his Build, Build, Build program, 
						which was Duterte's initiative of different flagship infrastructure projects all over the Philippines. The 
						inauguration date of CCLEX, April 27, 2022, coincided with the onset of the campaign season for the 2022 Philippine 
						general elections; thus, it has been a point of interest to analyze the association of misattributing tweets about this 
						project during this time period. This research project aims to discover patterns on tweets that incorrectly credit this 
						infrastructure to the Build, Build, Build campaign, with a greater objective of combating the rampant mis/disinformation 
						plague in social media today.<br>

								<h3 style="color:#002034">Data Collection</h3>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; color:#002034"><br>TOOLS</span><br>
								The group collected tweets primarily through two ways: the <b>Advanced Search feature</b> in the 
								Twitter website, and the automated <b>Apify Twitter Scraper</b>.<br>
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; color:#002034">COLLECTION PERIOD</span><br>
								Data collection spanned from March 6, 2023 to April 13, 2023, while additional tweets were 
								gathered on June 16, 2023. <br>
								Overall, a total of <strong>165 tweets</strong> were gathered.
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; color:#002034">KEYWORDS</span><br>
								Using the aforementioned tools, misattributing tweets were gathered with the following keywords: <br>
								<b>Terms related to CCLEX</b> - cclex, #cclex, cebu cordova <br>
								<b>Terms related to Build, Build, Build</b> - #buildbuildbuild, buildbuildbuild, bbb <br>
								<b>Terms related to Rodrigo Duterte</b> - #dutertelegacy #tatakduterte, tatak duterte, prrd, duterte, digong <br>
								<b>Terms related to giving credit</b> - salamat, #salamatprrd, #salamatduterte, salamat duterte, salamat prrd, thanks, project<br></p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">Any tweet that included any reference to Build, Build, Build were included, as CCLEX was not included as a flagship project in this campaign, thus crediting this project to BBB would have been misinformation.</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">Furthermore, the group only gathered misattributing tweets that were made from 2020 onwards. Only a small portion of the tweets were authored from 2016 to 2020. Thus, the inclusion of this 4-year span may skew the results, especially when performing linear regression on the frequency of tweets pre-campaign period.

								<h3 style="color:#002034">Data Features</h3>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black"><br>The following data features were recorded:<br><br>
								The credentials of the account were gathered: <b>Account Handle</b>, <b>Display Name</b>, and <b>Account Bio</b>.<br><br>
								Another data feature would be <b>Account Type</b>, wherein the accounts were classified into three categories:<br>
								- <span style="font-style:italic">Anonymous</span>, if there was no way of verifying the identities behind these accounts.<br>
								- <span style="font-style:italic">Identified</span>, if the account name or handle has verifiable credentials.<br>
								- <span style="font-style:italic">Media</span>, if the account’s primary purpose was to publish news or information in the platform.<br><br>
								Furthermore, other account information was obtained: <b>Joined Date</b>, <b>Follower Count</b> (the number of Twitter accounts that follow the author), <b>Following Count</b> (the number of Twitter accounts that the author follows), and <b>Account Location</b>.<br><br>
								Moreover, several features of the tweet were collected, such as the <b>Tweet Content</b> itself, the <b>Tweet URL</b>, and the <b>Publication Date</b> of the tweet.<br><br>
								Another feature, <b>Tweet Type</b>, was also recorded, if the tweet contains a text, image, video, URL. It also notes if the tweet was a reply or a quote tweet.<br><br>
								<b>Content Type</b> classifies the tweets into two categories:<br>
								- <span style="font-style:italic">Rational</span>, if the tweet has a purpose of being informational.<br>
								- <span style="font-style:italic">Emotional</span>, if the tweet states an opinion, emotion, or experience.<br>
								However, some tweets were classified as <i>both rational and emotional</i>, in which there were a combination of both contents in the tweet.<br><br>
								Lastly, the number of engagements with the tweet were also garnered: <b>Likes</b>, <b>Replies</b>, <b>Retweets</b>, and <b>Quote Tweets</b>.

							<article class="box style2" align="center" style="width:1200px">

								<h3 style="color:#002034">Data Preprocessing</h3>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; color:#002034"><br>ENSURING FORMATTING CONSISTENCY</span><br>
								For this step, the content type of the tweets were verified. Particularly, tweets that were both rational 
								and emotional were altered to have the same format of “Rational, Emotional” to ensure that the code will 
								classify the tweets into one category. Additionally, the date formats of the tweets were also rechecked, 
								and modified to have the format YY/MM/DD. This is to make it easier to sort the data upon performing linear regression.<br>
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; color:#002034">STANDARDIZATION</span><br>
								Standardization was done with the tweets’ likes, retweets, replies, and quote tweets, by getting the z-score 
								of the tweets in terms of these four features. This was done to identify possible outliers in the dataset.
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; color:#002034">HANDLING OUTLIERS</span><br>
								For this study, outliers were considered as tweets that attained a z-score of 3.00 and above, in terms of likes, 
								replies, retweets, and quote tweets. Upon standardization, 3 outliers were discovered. Since this is merely a 
								minimal percentage of the tweets gathered, the researchers decided to omit these tweets, bringing the total number 
								of tweets in the dataset to 162.
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; color:#002034">CATEGORICAL DATA ENCODING</span><br>
								Additionally, certain categorical features in the dataset were converted to a quantifiable value. This is 
								particularly seen with the tweet types feature. A value of 1 was set for tweets who included a certain media type 
								(e.g. photo/video, URL), while a value of 0 indicates the absence of such.
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; color:#002034">HANDLING MISSING VALUES</span><br>
								Upon reviewing the data collected, three features were found to be inconsistent.<br><br>
								<b>Views.</b> The view count of most tweets were unavailable during data collection; thus, the researchers decided 
								to disregard this tweet feature for the subsequent parts of the study. <br><br>
								<b>Location</b> The account locations of the tweet authors were inconsistent. Some accounts had dubious locations, 
								while others did not provide a location in their account. Meanwhile, most accounts had the location “Philippines” or 
								“Republic of the Philippines,” which are broad, and thus, will not provide much insight with the dataset. Thus, the 
								researchers have also decided to dismiss this tweet feature. <br><br>
								<b>Account Bio.</b> The account bios of tweet authors were also inconsistent. Similar to account location, some
								accounts did not have a bio. Meanwhile, other account bios do not provide significant insight into the study, as
								they were unrelated to the topic. Thus, the researchers have decided to omit this tweet feature.
								</p>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; color:#002034">TIME-SERIES ANALYSIS PREPARATION</span><br>
								Data were binned to yearly, monthly, and weekly intervals using pivot tables in MS Excel. This is due to the difficulties
								of binning weekly intervals in Python.

								<h3 style="color:#002034">Statistical Hypothesis Test</h3>
								<p align = "justify" style = "color:black">
								<br>The process behind the statistical testing for this project could be seen in this
								<a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sJ3kz263nCIPX6TDBSeozK-Zsko54wih">Google Colab file</a>.<br>
								<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; color:#002034"><br>ASSUMPTIONS</span><br>
								Simple linear regression models rely on three main assumptions about the data.<br><br>
								The first assumption is the <b>homogeneity of variance</b>, which implies that the 
								error size in the prediction remains relatively constant across different values of 
								the independent variable. It is important to note that linear regression minimizes 
								the root mean square error (RMSE), and thus, regions with higher error have a greater 
								impact on the model. To address this, the dataset is segmented to prevent skewed results, 
								and separate regression models are applied to each segment.<br><br>
								The second assumption is the <b>independence of observations</b>. This means that the dataset's 
								observations were collected using valid sampling methods. Failing to use appropriate sampling 
								methods introduces bias into the dataset, which may result in a hidden relationship that exists 
								only within the sample and not within the actual population. To mitigate this, simple random 
								sampling is employed during data collection.<br><br>
								The last assumption is <b>linearity</b>. Linearity assumes that the relationship between the independent 
								and dependent variable is linear. If a linear relationship is not present in the dataset, nonlinear 
								regression models are more preferred. To confirm that a linear regression model will suffice for the 
								dataset, line graphs were  manually inspected for linear and non-linear patterns during data visualization.

								<b>Pre-Campaign Period:</b><br>
								There is a <u>significant relationship</u> between the misattribution tweets of CCLEX to Duterte and 
								Build, Build, Build program in the pre-campaign period with p-value of 7.5539692847433205x10-6,

								<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; color:#002034"><br>EVENT DETECTION MODELS</span><br>
								The researchers decided to use the following machine learning models in the study:
								<b>Peak Detection</b>, <b>Change Point Detection</b>, and <b>Anomaly Detection</b>.<br><br>
								First, <b>peak detection</b> spots all local maxima by comparing its neighboring values. Moreover, 
								subsets of peaks can be identified by setting values to the peak’s properties such as height, width, 
								threshold, distance, and prominence.<br><br>
								Second, <b>change point detection</b> works by identifying time steps when some statistical property changes, 
								in the case of the study, frequency. Moreover, the researchers decided to use the ruptures Python library for 
								the offline change point detection. The detection was done via the Pelt algorithm as well as imposing a penalty 
								value for the algorithm. The output features of this machine learning model are the number of change points as 
								well as its corresponding dates.<br><br>
								Lastly, <b>anomaly detection</b> works by identifying data points that deviate from the dataset’s normal behavior. 
								The unsupervised detection technique was done using isolation forests which uses a tree structure wherein data points 
								are subsampled based on randomly selected features. Moreover, data points that end up on shorter branches indicate 
								anomalies as these were easier for the tree to separate these from other observations.

								<span style="font-weight:bold; font-size:110%; color:#002034">MODEL TRAINING</span><br>
								<b>Peak Detection.</b> The researchers decided to set the parameters to the following values in peak detection: 
								<b>height</b> to <b>5</b>, denoting that minimum of 5 weekly tweets; <b>width</b> to <b>1</b>, which means “breadth of a peak” is 1; 
								<b>threshold</b> to <b>1</b>, meaning the vertical distance between weekly tweets is set to 1; <b>distance</b> to 
								<b>4</b>, indicating that peaks have distance of a month since the researchers used weekly intervals; and <b>prominence</b> 
								to <b>3</b>, which denotes that the minimum vertical distance between the peak and its contour line.<br><br>
								<b>Change-Point Detection.</b> Meanwhile, the researchers set the <b>penalty value</b> of the Pelt algorithm in Change Point detection 
								to <b>1.25</b>, by means of <b>visual inspection</b>. The researchers opt for this value as lower penalty value led to more change points that 
								can be caused by noise as well as lesser significance of identified change points, meanwhile setting higher penalty value might miss out 
								relevant change points in the dataset.<br><br>
								<b>Anomaly Detection.</b> Lastly, the researchers opted for a conservative value for the contamination parameter in Anomaly detection. 
								The researchers set the value for the <b>contamination parameter</b> to <b>0.004</b> which indicates the fraction of the dataset containing 
								abnormal instances.

								<!-- Introduction -->
								The plague of misinformation in the Philippines is nothing new to its society. Various cases of credit-grabbing 
								have been notorious throughout the country’s history, serving the benefit of polishing the image of a famous politician 
								or personality. On the other hand, time periods such as the national elections have always been an avenue for such deception 
								to occur, where campaigning tactics could use the spread of false claims and information to gain the upper hand.<br><br>
								To further elaborate, the phenomenon of CCLEX’s misattribution could be perceived as political posturing by the previous administration. 
								This, all in an effort to take advantage of the opportunity to attract voters into believing that they have fulfilled their promise of 
								improving infrastructure in the country, hoping for a political dynasty to win the upcoming election, along with the political machinery 
								that they have created.<br><br>
								Given the predicament of these two phenomena in the country, the misattribution of CCLEX is a good point of analysis. Especially with its 
								inauguration date coinciding with the 2022 general elections, it could be possible that the trend of its misattribution could have been 
								correlated with this time period. <br><br>
								<!-- Methods -->
								Given such rationale, this research intended to find patterns among misattribution and the campaign period, through a time-analysis of 
								mis/disinforming tweets that incorrectly credit the construction of CCLEX to the Duterte administration and/or the Build, Build, Build program.<br><br>
								Through the use of scrapers and Twitter search features, the group was able to gather such misattributing tweets, particularly those published 
								from 2020 to 2022. Preliminary data visualization showed that most tweets were of purely emotional context, while anonymous Twitter accounts 
								contributed a lion’s share of the tweets gathered.<br><br>
								Thereafter, the group analyzed the trend in the frequency of misattribution among three time periods: pre, during, and post-campaign election, 
								which was done through fit-segmented linear regression. Meanwhile, machine learning was also utilized to obtain further insights through the use 
								of three event detection models: peak, change-point, and anomaly detection.<br><br>
								<!-- Results and Conclusion -->
								After performing linear regression and machine learning, the findings establish a significant trend in the misattribution of CCLEX to Duterte’s administration 
								and Build, Build, Build program before, during, and after the May 2022 electoral campaign. With this, the group discovered a significant correlation using such 
								regression analysis, along with the detected peaks and anomalies prior to the elections, and discovered change points before and after the election.<br><br>
								This strengthens the association between the onset of the campaign period and the frequency of misattribution. However, this does not imply causation, as the 
								identified peaks, change-points, and anomalies may merely coincide with particular events, such as the aforementioned inauguration, and multiple progress updates 
								published during its construction.<br><br>
								Thus, the group recommends looking further into the association of misattributing tweets about CCLEX to the campaign period, particularly with the context analysis 
								approach, to see if the sentiments were significantly related to the upcoming elections. Furthermore, the scope of future researches should also involve other social 
								media platforms, such as Facebook and TikTok, where mis/disinformation could also be rampant.<br><br>
								It could also be possible to look into other projects that are commonly misattributed, as well as other coinciding political and social events that may warrant a 
								trend of misinformation.<br><br>
								In conclusion, it is essential to recognize the extent of social media as a source of information nowadays, through which, the dissemination of false information 
								could have more drastic effects on society. The results of the project justifies such sentiment more, which should serve as a reminder for people to be more meticulous 
								with the information they receive. The presence of misattributing tweets that were classified as rational, and those that were published by media accounts are alarming, 
								as false information takes the guise of credibility to become more believable. Individual interventions are a step in the right direction; however, the heavier involvement 
								of more fact-checking in these platforms is even more suggested, especially during time periods such as elections, to better combat the dis/misinformation being perpetuated 
								all over the internet.
